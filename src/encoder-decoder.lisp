  ;; We took the method from https://stackoverflow.com/a/29579194/10376845.

  ;; Since the encoded messages for each symbol in each length bin are
  ;; numerically consecutive in value, we can quickly deduce whether a
  ;; read message is present in a length bin or not just by its length, its
  ;; value, the value of the first encoded message in the length bin, and the
  ;; size of the length bin.
